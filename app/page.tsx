            Software Engineering is commonly compared to Computer Science, and
            is often seen as its more-constrained, engineering-oriented
            counterpart. Prospective students may wonder whether Software
            Engineering is the right fit for them, and whether they will enjoy
            the environment. This profile attempts to showcase who SE 2030
            students are, what they have done, and their journey through
            university will be like.
